    // When rendering takes place via DirectX, and a console application
    // currently owns the screen, and a new console application is launched (or
    // the user switches to another console application), the new application
    // cannot take over the screen until the active one relinquishes it. This
    // blocking mechanism goes as follows:
    //
    // 1. The console input thread of the new console application connects to
    // ConIoSrv;
    // 2. While servicing the new connection request, ConIoSrv sends an event to
    // the active application letting it know that it has lost focus;
    // 3.1 ConIoSrv waits for a reply from the client application;
    // 3.2 Meanwhile, the active application receives the focus event and calls
    // this method, waiting for the current paint operation to
    // finish.
    //
    // This means that the new application is waiting on the connection request
    // reply from ConIoSrv, ConIoSrv is waiting on the active application to
    // acknowledge the lost focus event to reply to the new application, and the
    // console input thread in the active application is waiting on the renderer
    // thread to finish its current paint operation.
    //
    // Question: what should happen if the wait on the paint operation times
    // out?
    //
    // There are three options:
    //
    // 1. On timeout, the active console application could reply with an error
    // message and terminate itself, effectively relinquishing control of the
    // display;
    //
    // 2. ConIoSrv itself could time out on waiting for a reply, and forcibly
    // terminate the active console application;
    //
    // 3. Let the wait time out and let the user deal with it. Because the wait
    // occurs on a single iteration of the renderer thread, it seemed to me that
    // the likelihood of failure is extremely small, especially since the client
    // console application that the active conhost instance is servicing has no
    // say over what happens in the renderer thread, only by proxy. Thus, the
    // chance of failure (timeout) is minimal and since the OneCoreUAP console
    // is not a massively used piece of software, it didnâ€™t seem that it would
    // be a good use of time to build the requisite infrastructure to deal with
    // a timeout here, at least not for now. In case of a timeout DirectX will
    // catch the mistake of a new application attempting to acquire the display
    // while another one still owns it and will flag it as a DWM bug. Right now,
    // the active application will wait one second for the paint operation to
    // finish.
    //
    // TODO: MSFT: 11833883 - Determine action when wait on paint operation via
    //       DirectX on OneCoreUAP times out while switching console
    //       applications.
